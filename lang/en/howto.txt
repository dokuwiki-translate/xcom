    - Enter the URL to the remote site.  If your remote site is at ''%%http://www.example.com%%'' and the name of the wiki is ''my_wiki'', then you would enter  ''%%http://www.example.com/my_wiki%%''.

    - Select your query type from the drop-down ''Select query'' menu.
    - If your query requires a page id or namespace id, enter that in the ''Page/Namespace'' text box.
    - Some queries may require one or more additional options and others do not require page or namespace.  Clicking the ''Query types'' button will bring up a listing of query types and their options.  Enter these options, the order listed, separated by commas, in the ''Options/User-created query'' text box.  ** Do not ** re-enter page or namespace in this additional list of options.
    - There are more query types found on Dokuwiki's [[https://dokuwiki.org/devel:xmlrpc|xmlrpc page]] than are listed in the ''Select query'' menu.  If you want to use one of those, then enter the complete listing, including the function name.  Here the function name must come first and then, in order listed, the options, and all separated by commas, including the function name.
